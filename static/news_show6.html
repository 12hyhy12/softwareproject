							<h4>OpenAI’s AI robot hand learns to solve a Rubik Cube using Reinforcement learning and Automatic Domain Randomization</h4>
							<p>Source：https://hub.packtpub.com&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Release time：October 16, 2019</p>
						</div>
						
						<div class="xwnr">
							<p>A team of OpenAI researchers shared their research of training neural networks to solve a Rubik’s Cube with a human-like robot hand. The researchers trained the neural networks only in simulation using the same reinforcement learning code as OpenAI Five paired with a new technique called Automatic Domain Randomization (ADR).</p>
							<p>In their research paper, the team demonstrates how the system trained only in simulation can handle situations it never saw during training. “Solving a Rubik’s Cube one-handed is a challenging task even for humans, and it takes children several years to gain the dexterity required to master it. Our robot still hasn’t perfected its technique though, as it solves the Rubik’s Cube 60% of the time (and only 20% of the time for a maximally difficult scramble),” the researchers mention on their official blog. The Neural networks were also trained with Kociemba’s algorithm along with RL algorithms, for picking the solution steps.</p>
						    <h5>OpenAI’s AI-hand and the Giiker Cube</h5>
						    <p>The researchers have used the Shadow Dexterous E Series Hand (E3M5R) as a humanoid robot hand and the PhaseSpace motion capture system to track the Cartesian coordinates of all five fingertips. They have also used RGB Basler cameras for vision pose estimation. Sensing the state of a Rubik’s cube from vision alone is a challenging task. The team, therefore, used a “smart” Rubik’s cube with built-in sensors and a Bluetooth module as a stepping stone. They also used a Giiker cube for some of the experiments to test the control policy without compounding errors made by the vision model’s face angle predictions. The hardware is based on the Xiaomi Giiker cube. This cube is equipped with a Bluetooth module and allows one to sense the state of the Rubik’s cube. However, it is limited to a face angle resolution of 90◦ , which is not sufficient for state tracking purposes on the robot setup. The team, therefore, replaced some of the components of the original Giiker cube with custom ones in order to achieve a tracking accuracy of approximately 5 degrees.</p>
						    <h5>A few challenges faced</h5>
							<p>OpenAI’s method currently solves the Rubik’s Cube 20% of the time when applying a maximally difficult scramble that requires 26 face rotations. For simpler scrambles that require 15 rotations to undo, the success rate is 60%.</p>
                            <p>Researchers consider an attempt to have failed when the Rubik’s Cube is dropped or a timeout is reached. However, their network is capable of solving the Rubik’s Cube from any initial condition. So if the cube is dropped, it is possible to put it back into the hand and continue solving.</p>
                            <p>The neural network is much more likely to fail during the first few face rotations and flips. The team says this happens because the neural network needs to balance solving the Rubik’s Cube with adapting to the physical world during those early rotations and flips.</p>
