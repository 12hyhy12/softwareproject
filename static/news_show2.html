							<h4>A Star Algorithm</h4>
							<p>Source：Wikipedia&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Release time: November 16, 2019</p>
						</div>
						
						<div class="xwnr">
							<h5>1.</h5>
							<p>A star is a graph traversal and path search algorithm, which is often used in computer science due to its completeness, optimality, and optimal efficiency. One major practical drawback is its O(b^d) space complexity, as it stores all generated nodes in memory. Thus, in practical travel-routing systems, it is generally outperformed by algorithms which can pre-process the graph to attain better performance, as well as memory-bounded approaches; however, A star is still the best solution in many cases.</p>
						    <h5>2.</h5>
							<p>Peter Hart, Nils Nilsson and Bertram Raphael of Stanford Research Institute (now SRI International) first published the algorithm in 1968. It can be seen as an extension of Edsger Dijkstra's 1959 algorithm. A* achieves better performance by using heuristics to guide its search.
							<h5>3.</h5>
							<p>It does this by maintaining a tree of paths originating at the start node and extending those paths one edge at a time until its termination criterion is satisfied. At each iteration of its main loop, A* needs to determine which of its paths to extend. It does so based on the cost of the path and an estimate of the cost required to extend the path all the way to the goal.</p>
							<p>Specifically, A* selects the path that minimizes f(n)=g(n) + h(n) where n is the next node on the path, g(n) is the cost of the path from the start node to n, and h(n) is a heuristic function that estimates the cost of the cheapest path from n to the goal. A* terminates when the path it chooses to extend is a path from start to goal or if there are no paths eligible to be extended. The heuristic function is problem-specific. If the heuristic function is admissible, meaning that it never overestimates the actual cost to get to the goal, A* is guaranteed to return a least-cost path from start to goal.</p>
							<h5>4.</h5>
							<p>The time complexity of A* depends on the heuristic. In the worst case of an unbounded search space, the number of nodes expanded is exponential in the depth of the solution (the shortest path) d: O(bd), where b is the branching factor (the average number of successors per state). This assumes that a goal state exists at all, and is reachable from the start state; if it is not, and the state space is infinite, the algorithm will not terminate.</p>
                            <p>The space complexity of A* is roughly the same as that of all other graph search algorithms, as it keeps all generated nodes in memory. In practice, this turns out to be the biggest drawback of A* search, leading to the development of memory-bounded heuristic searches, such as Iterative deepening A*, memory bounded A*, and SMA*.</p>

							<h5>5.</h5>
						    <p>A* is commonly used for the common pathfinding problem in applications such as video games, but was originally designed as a general graph traversal algorithm. It finds applications to diverse problems, including the problem of parsing using stochastic grammars in NLP. Other cases include an Informational search with online learning.</p>
